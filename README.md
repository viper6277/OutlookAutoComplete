Outlook 2016 Auto Complete Parsing

As noted by : https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2199226

And with the use of the following software : https://archive.codeplex.com/?p=mfcmapi

You can extract the Auto Complete data from Outlook 2013, and Outlook 2016...the issue is

The only useful thing you can do with this is re-import later...but extracting the data....you're left
SOL !!!

Not anymore...
